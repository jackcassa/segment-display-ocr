2. General
----------
SegmentDisplayOCR is written using C++ (ISO/IEC 14882:1998) and is intended
to be used on Windows only. General compilation steps:

    1) Download sources from https://github.com/lcferrum/segment-display-ocr

    2) Compile it using Microsoft Visual Studio.

    3) After compiling, see the README.TXT file for instructions on using 
       SegmentDisplayOCR.

3. Specific compiling instructions
----------------------------------
The easiest way to compile SegmentDisplayOCR is by using included solution file
for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Open solution file, select Release
configuration and build solution. Compiled DLL can be found in Release directory.

Unfortunately, AviSynth C++ API (avisynth.h) uses Visual Studio specific code
so you can use compilers only from Visual Studio family. AviSynth C++ API 
included with this sources is from official 2.6.0 alpha release. Official
AviSynth release only supports 32-bit so if you want to compile 64-bit version
of SegmentDisplayOCR you'll need avisynth.h from unofficial 64-bit release you
intend to use. Keep in mind that SegmentDisplayOCR can't be compiled against
AviSynth C API and versions of AviSynth C++ API earlier than 5 (that is from
official 2.6.0 relase).

If you want to make Visual Studio project from scratch, consider the following:

    - Use empty Win32 console project with application type set to DLL as
      basis.
    - Add all the source files (.cpp, .h, .rc) to the project.
    - Change character set to multi-byte in project general settings.
    - Output DLL must be named SegmentDisplayOCR.dll.    
    - If using Visual Studio 2010 and higher, set platform toolset to v90.
      Otherwise, with higher value, you won't be able to use SegmentDisplayOCR
      on Windows 2000.
